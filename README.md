MNIST Handwritten Digit Classififcation Using Convoluted Neural Network
This is a DeepLearnng Mini Project I did after learning Convoluted Neural Network by myself as a Quarentine Goal.

I will be adding more features where we can write the number on a scratchpad and do simple mathematical operations on them.

here are some screenshots of the naive project:
